<h1>Hyena</h1>
<h4>Hyenas or hyaenas are feliform carnivoran mammals belonging to the family Hyaenidae.With just four extant species, it is the fourth-smallest family in the order Carnivora and one of the smallest in the class Mammalia.Despite their low diversity, hyenas are unique and vital components of most African ecosystems.</p>
<p>Although phylogenetically closer to felines and viverrids, hyenas are behaviourally and morphologically similar to canids in several elements due to convergent evolution: both hyenas and canines are non-arboreal, cursorial hunters that catch prey with their teeth rather than claws.Both eat food quickly and may store it, and their calloused feet with large, blunt, nonretractable claws are adapted for running and making sharp turns. However, hyenas' grooming, scent marking, defecation habits, mating and parental behavior are consistent with the behavior of other feliforms.</h4>

<h4>Hyenas feature prominently in the folklore and mythology of human cultures that live alongside them.Hyenas are commonly viewed as frightening and worthy of contempt.In some cultures, hyenas are thought to influence people's spirits, rob graves, and steal livestock and children.Other cultures associate them with witchcraft, using their body parts in traditional medicine.</h4>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Origins</h2>
<h4>Hyenas originated in the jungles of Miocene Eurasia 22 million years ago, when most early feliform species were still largely arboreal. The first ancestral hyenas were likely similar to the modern African civet; one of the earliest hyena species described, Plioviverrops, was a lithe, civet-like animal that inhabited Eurasia 20â€“22 million years ago, and is identifiable as a hyaenid by the structure of the middle ear and dentition. The lineage of Plioviverrops prospered, and gave rise to descendants with longer legs and more pointed jaws, a direction similar to that taken by canids in North America.Hyenas then diversified into two distinct types: lightly built dog-like hyenas and robust bone-crushing hyenas. Although the dog-like hyenas thrived 15 million years ago (with one taxon having colonised North America), they became extinct after a change in climate, along with the arrival of canids into Eurasia. Of the dog-like hyena lineage, only the insectivorous aardwolf survived, while the bone-crushing hyenas (including the extant spotted, brown and striped hyenas) became the undisputed top scavengers of Eurasia and Africa.</h4>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Behavior</h2>
<h4>Hyenas groom themselves often like felids and viverrids, and their way of licking their genitals is very cat-like (sitting on the lower back, legs spread with one leg pointing vertically upward).They defecate in the same manner as other Carnivora, though they never raise their legs as canids do when urinating, as urination serves no territorial function for them. Instead, hyenas mark their territories using their anal glands, a trait found also in viverrids and mustelids, but not canids and felids.When attacked by lions or dogs, striped and brown hyenas will feign death, though the spotted hyena will defend itself ferociously.The spotted hyena is very vocal, producing a number of different sounds consisting of whoops, grunts, groans, lows, giggles, yells, growls, laughs and whines.The striped hyena is comparatively silent, its vocalizations being limited to a chattering laugh and howling.</h4>
<h4>Mating between hyenas involves a number of short copulations with brief intervals, unlike canids, who generally engage in a single, drawn out copulation.[42] Spotted hyena cubs are born almost fully developed, with their eyes open and erupting incisors and canines, though lacking adult markings.[47] In contrast, striped hyena cubs are born with adult markings, closed eyes and small ears.[48] Hyenas do not regurgitate food for their young and male spotted hyenas play no part in raising their cubs,[42] though male striped hyenas do so.</h4>
